# SafeYatra – AI-Powered Pilgrim Safety with AeroRover-X  

**“Predict. Prevent. Protect.”** – SafeYatra redefines safety at mass gatherings.  

## The Problem :
Mass gatherings like **Kumbh, Rath Yatra, and Hajj** often turn tragic:  
- **Overcrowding & Stampedes** – thousands of preventable deaths.  
- **Lost Pilgrims** – children & elderly without real-time tracing.  
- **Delayed Emergency Response** – congested routes & inaccessible areas.  
- **Existing Tools** (CCTV, RFID, drones) → reactive, **not predictive**.  

The challenge: **How do we make pilgrimages safer, smarter, and stampede-free?**  

## Our Solution – *SafeYatra with AeroRover-X*  :
An **AI-powered hybrid drone-rover** designed for proactive safety:  
- **Hybrid Mobility**: Propeller-to-wheel → flies above crowds, roves through alleys.  
- **AI Surveillance**: Predictive heatmaps, anomaly detection, and facial recognition.  
- **Rapid Medical Response**: Delivers kits & AEDs within minutes.  
- **Lost & Found**: Instant identification of missing persons.  
- **Pilgrim App**: SOS button, live crowd maps, multilingual guidance.  

## Innovation & Uniqueness :
- **Propeller-to-Wheel**: Dual air + ground adaptability.  
- **AI Autonomy**: Smart path planning & hazard detection.  
- **Rescue Bay**: Temperature-controlled chamber for medicines & vaccines.  
- **Surveillance Kit**: Thermal + HD cameras, comm relays, modular payloads.  
- **Energy System**: Solar assist + wireless docking + battery swap.  
- **V2V Sync**: Fleet-wide drone-to-drone coordination.  
- **Multi-Sector Ready**: Healthcare, defense, logistics, disaster response.  

## Tech & Architecture :
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano (edge AI), Pixhawk 4, ESP32, HD+Thermal cams, LIDAR, IoT sensors.  
- **AI Models**:  
  - YOLOv8 + DeepSORT → object & anomaly detection  
  - FaceNet + MTCNN → missing person recognition  
  - LSTM forecasting → predictive crowd flow  
  - RL (DQN) → dynamic path planning  
- **Ecosystem**: Cloud dashboard (React.js), Pilgrim mobile app (Flutter), centralized command center.
